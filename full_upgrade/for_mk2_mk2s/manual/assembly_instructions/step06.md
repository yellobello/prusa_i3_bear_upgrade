# Prusa i3 Full Upgrade MK2(s)

## Assembly Instructions

### Step 6

#### Parts  

* 1x 290mm v-slot
* 2x 356mm v-slots
* 6x 90° joining plates
* 18x M5x10mm screws
* 23x Tee nuts

#### Assembly

1. :warning: If you did not get your kit from our official distributors, you might have to file sharp edges on the diagonal of 90° joining plates (figure 6.1). A small chamfer is enough, this just to avoid scratching cables
2. Assemble 2x 356mm v-slots with one 290mm v-slot as seen on figure 6.2 with 2x 90° joining plates, 10x M5x10 screws and 10x tee nuts. Make sure the tapped holes at the end of the 356mm extrusions are on top
3. Check all dimensions as seen on figure 6.3<br>
   :warning: this step is very important, double check everything is perfectly square
4. Insert 3 tee nuts on one side for future assembly of the power supply (Step 15) and 2 tee nuts on the other side of the frame for future assembly of the einsy board (Step 16)  
5. File **all** sharp edges of 4x latest 90° joining plates (not only diagonals) (figure 6.1). A small chamfer is enough, this just to avoid scratching cables and it will be useful for the next step as well
6. Assemble the 4x latest 90° joining plates as seen on figure 6.4
   :warning: Make sure the tapped holes at the end of the 356mm extrusions are on top
